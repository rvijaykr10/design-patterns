Hereâ€™s a summary of all the design patterns used in the FastAPI:

1. Factory Pattern
Purpose: Creates objects dynamically based on runtime conditions (e.g., database connections or services).

Example: A DatabaseFactory class creates different types of database clients (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) based on input.
2. Observer Pattern
Purpose: Allows a subject to notify its observers when a state change occurs, often used for event-driven systems like logging or notifications.

Example: A Subject class notifies multiple observers (like Logger and Notifier) when a new user registers.
3. Strategy Pattern
Purpose: Allows switching between different algorithms or strategies based on user input or runtime conditions.

Example: A TextProcessor class uses different strategies to convert text to uppercase or lowercase.
4. Singleton Pattern
Purpose: Ensures only one instance of a class is created and used throughout the application.

Example: A Logger class that ensures only one instance exists for logging messages across different parts of the application.
5. Abstract Factory Pattern
Purpose: Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Example: A UIFactory creates different types of UI elements (buttons) depending on the operating system (Windows or Mac).
6. Builder Pattern
Purpose: Helps construct complex objects step by step, often used for objects with many attributes.

Example: A ResponseBuilder class builds a structured response by adding status, message, and data.
7. Chain of Responsibility Pattern
Purpose: Passes a request along a chain of handlers, where each handler can process the request or pass it on.

Example: An HTTP request passes through authentication and logging handlers in sequence.
8. Command Pattern
Purpose: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to decouple the sender and the receiver.

Example: Different commands (CreateUserCommand, DeleteUserCommand) are executed by a command invoker.
9. Composite Pattern
Purpose: Composes objects into tree-like structures for representing part-whole hierarchies.

Example: A Cart class can contain Item objects, and both Item and Cart implement the Component interface.
10. Decorator Pattern
Purpose: Dynamically adds behavior to objects by wrapping them in additional functionality.

Example: The check_permissions decorator adds behavior to routes to ensure the user has the correct permissions before accessing a route.
11. Flyweight Pattern
Purpose: Reduces memory usage by sharing common objects, used when many objects are created that have shared attributes.

Example: A Logger class where only one instance is used, ensuring that logging behavior is shared across different parts of the system.
12. Iterator Pattern
Purpose: Allows iteration over a collection without exposing its underlying structure.

Example: An ItemIterator is used to iterate over a list of items (like fruits) in a cart.
13. Mediator Pattern
Purpose: Centralizes communication between objects to reduce direct dependencies, improving maintainability.

Example: An EmailService and SMSService send notifications through a mediator pattern, reducing dependencies between them.
14. Adapter Pattern
Purpose: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by creating an adapter that translates one interface into another.

Example: A MongoDBAdapter converts the interface of MongoDBClient to match the DatabaseClient interface.
15. Proxy Pattern
Purpose: Provides a surrogate or placeholder to control access to an object, often for lazy loading, security, or performance reasons.

Example: A ProxyService class acts as an intermediary to add additional logic (such as permission checks) before delegating the task to RealService.
16. State Pattern
Purpose: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes, making state transitions explicit.

Example: A Context class changes its state between ConcreteStateA and ConcreteStateB when the state is requested.
17. Template Method Pattern
Purpose: Defines the structure of an algorithm, allowing specific steps to be implemented by subclasses.

Example: A ConcreteDataProcessor class implements specific steps (load_data, clean_data, analyze_data) for processing data while using the template defined in DataProcessor.
18. Memento Pattern
Purpose: Captures and externalizes an object's internal state so it can be restored later without violating encapsulation.

Example: An Originator object saves its state (using Memento), which can later be restored, allowing undo functionality.
19. Visitor Pattern
Purpose: Adds new operations to existing class structures without modifying the classes themselves.

Example: A ConcreteVisitor implements custom operations for visiting ConcreteElementA and ConcreteElementB objects.
20. Null Object Pattern
Purpose: Provides a default behavior for an object instead of returning None or null.

Example: A NullUser class is used when no user is provided, ensuring the application doesn't need to handle null values directly.
21. Bridge Pattern
Purpose: Decouples abstraction from its implementation so both can evolve independently.

Example: A Circle class uses a DrawingAPI (either DrawingAPI1 or DrawingAPI2) to draw circles without being tightly coupled to the specific implementation.
Summary of Key Benefits of Design Patterns:
Reusability: Many design patterns promote code reuse and flexibility, making it easier to apply in different parts of the application.
Maintainability: They help keep the codebase clean and easier to maintain, with clear responsibilities for each class or object.
Decoupling: Patterns like the Strategy and Mediator allow components to be more decoupled, reducing direct dependencies.
Performance Optimization: Patterns like the Flyweight and Proxy improve resource usage and control access to resources, leading to better performance.
Each design pattern helps address specific problems in system design by introducing solutions that improve flexibility, maintainability, and scalability, especially in a web framework like FastAPI.
